# bangali's random code stuff for SmartThings.

While ST has a concept of rooms it is essentially a grouping mechanism which does not enable automation. In contrast rooms occupancy considers the room as a meta device and automates common tasks associated with a ‚Äúroom‚Äù physical or virtual. What makes it really useful is not just the room's occupancy state but the ability to manage automation for rooms in a set of rules for the room based on the occupancy state of the room and data from various sensors. When creating a room device through the smartapp you are able to create these rules for the rooms making your rooms really smart.

But even importantly perhaps it gets you the kind of WAF for your home automation that you have always dreamed about. üôÇ

What these rules enable is many common tasks around rooms which most users go through automating at some point. Usually through setting up a few rules or creating a few pistons. I have been there and done that myself. While those work to a degree, it does not enable the kind of comprehensive automation that should be possible for devices in a room based on sensor and device inputs. This smartapp makes that possible.

If there is one principle that these apps are built on, it is - that your home automation should work in the background in a repeatable and predictable manner without requiring periodic human intervention. In short - your automation should work for you and not the other way around. üôÇ

Additionally, these rooms devices also have attributes, capabilities and commands which are useable in webCoRE or other smartapps like Smart Lighting in ST or rule machine in Hubitat. There is a range of other automations that webCoRE makes possible that could not otherwise be done without writing a custom smartapp for it. I use webCoRE for that and am I big fan of Adrian. So checkout webCoRE as well if you don't already use it.

Here are the room occupancy states that most users will deal it:
- Occupied:
- Engaged:
- Asleep:
- Vacant:
- Checking:

The states 'locked', 'reserved' and 'kaput' stop automation so use these when you temporarily want to control lights and switches in the room either manually or some other way.

Here is a quick description of the various top level settings and how the app works. At the heart of the app is the concept of room states and rules to automate devices based on these room's states and other sensor inputs. (In the following description when I talk about sensors it refers to devices that have attributes which are used to drive decisions in the room's rules.)

Here are the top level settings:
- Occupied Settings
- Engaged Settings
- Checking Settings
- Vacant Settings
- Asleep Settings
- Locked Settings
- Other Devices
- Auto Level 'AL' Settings
- Holiday Lights 'HL' Settings
- Temperature Settings
- Maintain Rules
- Adjacent Room Settings
- Mode and Other Settings
- View All Settings

Think of occupied as a transient state and engaged as a persistent state.

Occupied is you go to a room are in there for a few minutes then leave the room. lights come on when you enter the room and turn off after a couple of minutes of your leaving the room.

Engaged is when you stay in a room for an extended period of time and may be motionless for some or all of the time. since we cant depend on the motion event for engaged state there are different options to set the room to engaged for extended occupancy. these are all under engaged settings and there is more coming. but these help make sure the switches you set to on stay on even if there is no motion in the room.

When in engaged state you have a different and longer timeout state than the occupied state. So there is still a motion requirement but a much higher time threshold than the transient occupied state.

This is only a part of what's possible through this app. please take a look at all settings for a room in the app to get a sense of what else is possible.

When creating a room first give the room a name and save the room then go back in to the room to add various settings to the room.

`For a github install from repo in ST use : owner: adey / name: bangali / branch: master. Install and publish the rooms occupancy DTH then install and publish the rooms manager and rooms child app smartapps.`

`For a manual install here are the links, in order of DTHs and smartapps you should save and publish.`

Knowing that users are finding their app useful enough to support development of the app is always motivating for any dev. So here is the donation link. To be clear ... _no donation is required or expected to use rooms manager_. But if you do donate please also know that it is much appreciated. With that, if you feel like it ... <a href="https://www.paypal.me/dey">please donate here</a>.
