*  Name: Room Manager
*  Source: https://github.com/adey/bangali/blob/master/smartapps/bangali/rooms-manager.src/rooms-manager.groovy
*
*  Version: 0.05.7
*
*   DONE:   11/20/2017
*   1) added support for room busy check.
*   2) added support for arrival and/or departure action when using presence sensor.
*   3) some bug fixes.
*
*  Version: 0.05.5
*
*   DONE:   11/19/2017
*   1) added sleepSensor feature and corresponding settings by https://github.com/Johnwillliam.
*   2) some bug fixes.
*
*  Version: 0.05.2
*
*   DONE:   11/16/2017
*   1) changed from 10 to 12 device settings and added adjacent rooms to devices display.
*   2) some bug fixes.
*
*  Version: 0.05.1
*
*   DONE:   11/15/2017
*   1) added setting to select which days of week this rooms automation should run.
*
*  Version: 0.05.0
*
*   DONE:   11/13/2017
*   1) expanded the adjacent room settings. if you specify adjacent rooms you can choose 2 options:
*       i) if there is motion in an adjacent room you can force the current room to check for motion and on no
*           motion change room state to vacant.
*      ii) if there is motion in an adjacent room you can turn on lights in this room if it is currently vacant.
*           this allows for the adjacent rooms feature to be used as a light your pathway can kind of setup.
*   2) some bug fixes.
*
*  Version: 0.04.6
*
*   DONE:   11/12/2017
*   1) bug fixes around contact sensors..
*
*  Version: 0.04.5
*
*   DONE:   11/10/2017
*   1) revamped device details screen. if users dont like it will revert back.
*   2) when swiches are turned off because lux rose or is outside of time window added settings to turn off both
*           group of switches instead of just switches off.
*   3) added option to change state directly from engaged to vacant without moving to checking state.
*	4) removed last event from status message.
*
*  Version: 0.04.3
*
*   DONE:   11/8/2017
*   1) added last event to status message.
*   2) added concept of adjacent rooms that you can select in room settings. setting does not do anything yet :-)
*
*  Version: 0.04.2
*
*   DONE:   11/6/2017
*   1) added setting option to allow timeout from last motion active or on motion inactive. if motion has a long timeout
*           this will allow the lights to turn off quicker. but be aware motion sensor may show motion due to long
*           timeout while room indicates its vacant.
*
*  Version: 0.04.1
*
*   DONE:   11/3/2017
*   1) added support for time window to turn on/off switches when between those times. this works with other settings
*           as well. like if lux is specified both the lux setting and the time setting have to be true for switches
*           to be turned on or off.
*
*  Version: 0.04
*
*   DONE:   11/3/2017
*   1) added support for presence sensor to change room state to engaged when present. when presence sensor is not
*           present the room automation should work normally.
*   2) added support for modes which when set cause all automation to be bypassed if location is any of those modes.
*
*  Version: 0.03.7
*
*   DONE:   11/1/2017
*   1) added support for contact sensor. when contact sensor changes to closed room will be set to checking state.
*           if there is no motion afterwards room will be set to vacant. if there is motion, room will be set to
*           engaged which stops room automation from kicking in till the contact is opened again.
*           when contact sensor changes to open room will be set to checking state so automation can resume again.
*           the only exception to this is home changing to away in which case room will be set to vacant.
*   2) when contact sensor is specified but no motion sensor is specified room will be changed to engaged when
*           contact sensor closes.
*   3) if there is a motion sensor specified but no motion timeout value then room will be changed to vacant when
*           motion sensor becomes inactive and room is in occupied or checking state.
*   4) added engaged switch which when turned on will mark the room as engaged to stop automation. this gets a
*           little tricky when both engaged switch and contact sensor is defined. the contact sensor changing to
*           open will reset the state back to checking. but if there is subsequent motion in the room within the
*           timeout period the room will be set to occupied. or if the door is closed again and there is subsequent
*           motion in the room within the timeout period the room will be set to engaged stopping automation.
*   5) added lights control with lux for engaged state.
*   6) added button push to toogle room state between engaged and checking when room state is already engaged.
*
*  Version: 0.03.5
*
*   DONE:   10/29/2017
*   1) added support for setting level and/or color temperature for turning on switches. these will be set for
*           those devices in the turn on switchs list that support it.
*   2) since motion inactive timeout can vary so widely amongst different brands of motion sensors chose not to
*           use motion inactive event and instead timeout on motion active event for predictable user experience.
*   3) added support for dimming before turning off light.
*   4) added support for color setting which takes preference over color temperature if the switch supports it.
*   5) fixed small bugs.
*
*  Version: 0.03.1
*
*   DONE:   10/27/2017
*   1) added support for lux sensor and lux value. if these values are specified:
*       a) if lux value falls <= that value and switches on are selected those switches will be turned on.
*       b) if lux value rises > that value and switches off are selected those switches will be turned off.
*       c) switches on with motion will be turned on only when lux value is <= that value.
*   2) fixed small bugs.
*
*  Version: 0.03
*
*   DONE:
*   1) added new states do not disturb and asleep, on user demand. these have button value of 7 and 8 respectively.
*	2) locked and kaput moved below the fold and replaced on-screen with do not disturb and asleep respectively.
*   3) cleaned up settings display.
*   4) changed roomOccupancy to occupancyStatus. sorry for the compatibility breaking change. by user demand.
*   5) updated some interstitial text.
*   6) if no motion sensor specified but there is a timeout value >= 5 and turn off switches specified, those
*            switches will be switched off after timeout seconds if room is vacant.
*	7) added new engaged state, on user demand. this button has a button value of 9 respectively.
*   8) if room state changes any pending actions are cancelled.
*
*  Version: 0.02
*
*   DONE:
*	0) Initial commit.
*   1) added support for multiple away modes. when home changes to any these modes room is set to vacant but
*            only if room is in occupied or checking state.
*   2) added subscription for motion devices so if room is vacant or checking move room state to occupied.
*   3) added support for switches to be turned on when room is changed to occupied.
*   4) added support for switches to be turned off when room is changed to vacant, different switches from #3.
*   5) added button push events to tile commands, where occupied = button 1, ..., kaput = button 6 so it is
*           supported by ST Smart Lighting smartapp.
